* Lab 07

   Lab 7 part 1, was one of my favorite labs because it used multiple if 
   statements to create a system to determine if parking was valid on a 
   certain street at a specific time. I could write various if and if else 
   statements to make the functions check the inputs on the command line. 
   This lab also showed how to communicate between two .cc files to filter 
   out the command line inputs to be tested among the if statements created 
   to check if parking was allowed.

* Lab 05

    Lab 5 part 2, was another favorite because it was interesting to see how 
    static casts function to change data types to work in certain equations. 
    This lab also taught us how min and max functions determine if the input 
    was less than the maximum and greater than the minimum. This lab showed 
    how to use the truc() function to return the whole number so the double 
    variables were allowed to be passed through the static cast to convert it 
    into an int. 

* Lab 08

    Lab 08, was my third favorite lab because it utilized the two types of for-loops taught in the lecture class. Inside part 1, I used a for loop and looped through each of the elements inside the vector of doubles, and for part 2 utilizing the variable i created a nice pattern of character because this was a counter-controlled loop where after a certain amount of increments, or decrements the loop would end. This helps to show the difference between both types of for-loops taught.
