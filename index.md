Lab 07:
 Lab 7 part 1, was one of my favorite labs because it used multiple if statements to create a system to determine if parking was vailid on a certain street at a specific time. I was able to writed various if and if else statement to create the functions to check the inputs.

Lab 05:
 Lab 5 part 2, was another favorite because it interesting to see how static casts functions to change data types to work in certain equations. This lab also taught us about the min and max functions do determine if the input was less than the maximum and greater than the minimum.

Lab 08:
 Lab 08, was my third favorite lab because of the cool pattern created with the counter control loop. These loops then created an amazing pattern by either incrementing i or decrementing i in their respective loops.
